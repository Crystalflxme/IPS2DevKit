# Heirarchy

This is the hierarchy of a valid and portable In Plain Sight 2 map.
All instances will have a name of what their instance is.

- Map - Folder
    - CamLocations - Folder
        - CamLocations contains only BaseParts
        - CanCollide is false, CanQuery is false, and CanTouch is true
		- Contains all CamLocation tagged instances
		- All instances have an attribute called DisplayName, storing a string, which displays to a camera as the name of the hatch
	- Clipping - Folder
		- Bounds - Folder
        - Contains only BaseParts
        - All instances are tagged `Clip_Bounds`
        - All instances have an attribute called Entrance, with the name of the Entrance's folder name which it teleports you to upon touching it
        - Instances named Broad will be disabled during the round start and round end, to allow for entering and escaping
        - Instances not named Broad always teleport thieves
        - CanCollide is false, CanQuery is false, and CanTouch is true
		- Entrance - Folder
        - Contains only BaseParts
        - All instances are tagged `Clip_Entrance`
        - CanCollide is true, CanQuery is true, and CanTouch is true
        - CanCollide set to false during round intro and escape sequence, to allow for entering and escaping
		- Player - Folder
        - Contains only BaseParts
        - All instances are tagged `Clip_Player`
        - CanCollide is true, CanQuery is true, and CanTouch is true
        - Instances that only thieves can collide with
        - Does not prevent camera lasers or any projectile from moving through
        - Mostly used for out of bounds protection
	- Entrances - Folder
		- ExitName - Folder
		    - Actions - Folder
		        - DriverSeat - Seat
                - A dude is sitting in it
		        - VanDoor - BasePart or UnionOperation
		            - Tweened to child instance named End on round start
		        - Door - BasePart or UnionOperation
		            - Tweened to child instance named End on Kick animation event
		        - Window - BasePart or UnionOperation
		            - Tweened to child instance named End on WindowCut animation event
		    - NPCPath - Folder
		        - Contains Baseparts, named 1, 2, ..., n
		        - 1 is the spawn point of the NPC
		        - BaseParts between 2 and n is the path the NPC walks to, in order, in a straight line between
		        - n is the final position of the NPC, where they will stand the rest of the round
		        - BaseParts are orientation sensitive, the NPC tries to follow the CFrame of the BasePart
		        - To do this efficiently, create a new R15 rig under the Avatar tab, with the Rig Builder button, and name them `funnyguy`
		        - Next, select a BasePart you wish to be a node
		        - Then, run this command: `game:GetService("Selection"):Get()[1].CFrame = game.Workspace.funnyguy.PrimaryPart.CFrame`
		        - This takes a part you have selected and moves it to orient itself with `funnyguy`
		        - Any NPCPath instance can have the following attributes:
		            - Animation, string, plays an animation at a given node:
		                - Kick
		                    - Kick requires an instance named Door
		                    - Will tween Door instance to CFrame of child instance End
		                - WindowCut
		                    - WindowCut requires an instance named Window
		                    - Will tween Window instance to CFrame of child instance End

		                    - Value is the name of the seat the NPC sits in
