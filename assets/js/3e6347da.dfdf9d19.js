they can be pushed around by thieves and cameras.\nNot a lot of people find Greenhorn fun or useful, but they're still in the game because they're fun for the people who enjoy their playstyle.\nGreenhorn offers something unique to the game that no other character currently fills.\nThey can build staircases for all thieves to use and build walls to protect thieves.\nThey can fill Bank's vault with rocks and grief people by trapping them in rooms.\nThey can build structures.\nThe idea of a character that can build structures is not a unique idea on its own.\nLots of folks have submitted characters that can build.\nLets take the basic concept of \"Activate your ability to build a wall in front of you\" as a thief\nand point out its flaws so we can make it more

building thief that was more permanent and less of a \"Press E to instantly live\" ability, to separate themselves from Cyb0rg, their competitor in this niche.\nI also wanted a thief that's versatile, capable of building many different kinds of useful structures.\nMy mind instantly turned to Minecraft, and a fighting game character named Kragg.\nA smaller wall, but you get a lot of them, solves many of the issues with the previous iteration.\nSmaller parts allows easier placement, and having a lot of them means you can arrange them in any way you want.\nSmaller parts also means that you can't place one instantly to save yourself, you have to plan ahead to shield yourself (and teammates!)\nThis is why they're 4x4x4 cubes, as a thief is 5 studs tall and cannot perfectly hide behind 1 rock.\nHaving them be physical objects that you can push around also contributes to the sandboxy theme of the character, and mostly prevents rocks from trapping other thieves, which was a big problem."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"This is the original version of Greenhorn released, with a 20 second cooldown for rocks.\nOriginally, the rocks couldn't be pushed by cameras, but could be pushed by thieves.\nThis wasn't terribly fun, as thieves could knock over your useful structures rendering them useless for the rest of the round.\nThis wasn't fun for cameras either, as they couldn't do a thing about it. Cameras without explosive shot were most affected by this.\nAnd lastly, it wasn't fun for the Greenhorn, as the 20 second cooldown didn't allow you to build cool structures quickly.\nThe cooldown of 20 seconds was intentional to balance out the fact that there was no counterplay for cameras."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"All of these issues had to be solved simultaneously.\nYou can't make rocks be pushed by cameras without lowering the cooldown of Mold Earth, otherwise they're useless.\nYou can't lower the cooldown of Mold Earth without having a limit to rocks, otherwise you can fill the map with rocks.\nIf you have a limit to your rocks, you need a way to pick them back up so that you're not without rocks the rest of the round."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"With some quality of life improvements, this is the current version of Greenhorn.\nAre they fun? To some people, yes.\nAre they perfect with no flaws?
