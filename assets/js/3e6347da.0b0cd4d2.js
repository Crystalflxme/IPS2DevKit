when planning on submitting something.\n\nMaking content for In Plain Sight 2 is difficult.\nIt is a unique game and the people working on it are always trying to improve the game for the better.\nStandards are always rising, and this makes it difficult for newcomers to catch up with said standards.\nFear not, however, as you're not alone in your endeavor.\n\nThe best way to ensure that your submitted content gets in the game is to get help from anyone willing to help.\nTalking about its concept early on will help greatly in many ways.\nWhether it's just a model, just an idea, or a vague sense of how it'll play, other people can help you create these ideas.\n\nWhen submitting a character...\nThe most important part to get right is how they'll play in-game.\nIf the character isn't fun, people will be less inclined to play them.\nFun is a very subjective term, people find different things fun, so getting feedback on what seems fun will be difficult.\nNot everyone will find your character fun.\n\nFor example...\nAs creator of this submission kit, I made Greenhorn.\nGreenhorn can summon or remove cubic rocks in front of them, up to 10 can be summoned, and they can be pushed around by thieves and cameras.\nNot a lot of people find Greenhorn fun or useful, but they're still in the game because they're fun for the people who enjoy their playstyle.\nGreenhorn offers something unique to the game that no other character currently fills.\nThey can build staircases for all thieves to use and build walls to protect thieves.\nThey can fill Bank's vault with rocks and grief people by trapping them in rooms.\nThey can build structures.\nThe idea of a character that can build structures is not a unique idea on its own.\nLots of folks have submitted characters that can build.\nLets take the basic concept of \"Activate your ability to build a wall in front of you\" as a thief\nand point out its flaws so we can make it more fun.\n\nFirstly, it's not fun to activate.\nYou activate it and spawn a wall in front of you with a 30 second cooldown.\nIf there is a system in place to prevent the wall from spawning in walls, if the wall is big enough, it's going to be really difficult to spawn a wall in no matter where you are.\nIf there ISN'T a system in place, then you can trap yourself or other thieves in rooms, which isn't fun.\n\nSecondly, neither thieves nor cameras can do anything about it, which isn't fun for anyone.\nThieves can't walk through it and cameras can't zap through it.\n\nFinally, the primary purpose of this ability is going to be instantly placing walls as you're being zapped by a camera.\nThe ability isn't flexible enough to be used for anything else.\n\nThere are many ways to solve these issues, and heavily depends on what you want out of the character.\nI wanted a building thief that was more permanent and less of a \"Press E to instantly live\" ability, to separate themselves from Cyb0rg, their competitor in this niche.\nI also wanted a thief that's versatile, capable of building many different kinds of useful structures.\nMy mind instantly turned to Minecraft, and a fighting game character named Kragg.\nA smaller wall, but you get a lot of them, solves many of the issues with the previous iteration.\nSmaller parts allows easier placement, and having a lot of them means you can arrange them in any way you want.\nSmaller parts also means that you can't place one instantly to save yourself, you have to plan ahead to shield yourself (and teammates!)\nThis is why they're 4x4x4 cubes, as a thief is 5 studs tall and cannot perfectly hide behind 1 rock.\nHaving them be physical objects that you can push around also contributes to the sandboxy theme of the character, and mostly prevents rocks from trapping other thieves, which was a big problem.\n\nThis is the original version of Greenhorn released, with a 20 second cooldown for rocks.\nOriginally, the rocks couldn't be pushed by cameras, but could be pushed by thieves.\nThis wasn't terribly fun, as thieves could knock over your useful structures rendering them useless for the rest of the round.\nThis wasn't fun for cameras either, as they couldn't do a thing about it. Cameras without explosive shot were most affected by this.\nAnd lastly, it wasn't fun for the Greenhorn, as the 20 second cooldown didn't allow you to build cool structures quickly.\nThe cooldown of 20 seconds was intentional to balance out the fact that there was no counterplay for cameras.\n\nAll of these issues had to be solved simultaneously.\nYou can't make rocks be pushed by cameras without lowering the cooldown of Mold Earth, otherwise they're useless.\nYou can't lower the cooldown of Mold Earth without having a limit to rocks, otherwise you can fill the map with rocks.\nIf you have a limit to your rocks, you need a way to pick them back up so that you're not without rocks the rest of the round.\n\nWith some quality of life improvements, this is the current version of Greenhorn.\nAre they fun? To some people, yes.\nAre they perfect with no flaws? Absolutely not.\nSummoning rocks in front of you is a janky way to summon rocks and makes it difficult to build advanced structures.\nNeeding to run over to your rocks to pick them back up after they're knocked over takes a LOT of time that could\nbe spent doing more fun things, like building or stealing, and becomes a worse problem as the maps get bigger.\n")))}p.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
